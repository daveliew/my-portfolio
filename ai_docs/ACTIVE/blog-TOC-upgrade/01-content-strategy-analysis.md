# Content Strategy Analysis: "Personal AI Strategy Coach" Positioning

**Date**: 2025-01-11
**Status**: Research Phase

## The Problem & Solution

**Problem**: Generic AI training feels overwhelming and irrelevant to successful professionals. They need someone they trust to create a personalized roadmap.

**Solution**: "Personal AI Strategy Coach" - assess their specific business context, learning style, and goals, then design a custom learning path with hands-on guidance.

**Service Model**: Hybrid approach
- Group workshops for frameworks
- 1-on-1 sessions for personalized implementation
- 4-6 week programs, $3-5K each

**Target Persona**: Successful professionals (consultants, advisors, domain experts) who need AI to amplify expertise without losing their edge.

## Current Content State

### ✅ What Already Exists

**Strong Learning Foundation** (free educational resources):
- `/ai-journey/how-to-learn/` - Three-Hat Framework, Technical Leadership
- `/ai-journey/claude-mastery/` - 8 comprehensive modules
- `/philosophy` - Fitzgerald Principle deep dive (9 sections)
- `/laboratory` - AI/Sustainability/Robotics convergence

**Hidden Proof-Points** (in JSON, not visible):
- 3 complete case studies in `/data/ai-journey.json`:
  1. Autonomous Research Team (CrewAI, 1/3 time delivery)
  2. Ray of Joy Therapy automation (n8n, OpenAI, Airtable)
  3. B2B Corporate Gift Platform (Next.js, BI)
- Each includes Three-Hat Framework breakdown
- **Portfolio page shows "Coming Soon"** - HIGH PRIORITY FIX

**Current Positioning**:
- "Building in public" educator
- "Systematic explorer" (not guru)
- "Let's compare notes" (peer collaboration)
- Contact page redirects to Agentic Brewery for consulting

### ❌ What's Missing

**No Service Middle Ground**:
- Free learning OR Agentic Brewery business consulting
- No personalized coaching tier visible

**No Coaching Pathway**:
- How to work with Dave not articulated
- No engagement model clarity (weekly calls? project-based?)
- No pricing transparency

**No Journey Narrative**:
- Dave's evolution from "AI intimidated" to "AI confident" not told
- Mistakes/learnings not shared (makes him relatable)
- Current client work mentioned but not detailed

**Portfolio Not Activated**:
- Case studies exist but hidden
- No visible proof of coaching effectiveness
- "Coming Soon" placeholder hurts credibility

## Recommended Content Strategy

### Phase 1: Activate Existing Assets (Week 1)

**High-ROI, Zero Content Writing**:
1. **Portfolio page activation** - Use existing case study JSON
2. **Contact page enhancement** - Add "Compare Notes" coaching pathway
3. **Now page update** - Add "Currently Coaching" section with active work

### Phase 2: Blog Series - "Becoming a Better Agentic Engineer" (Weeks 2-4)

**Article themes** (3-5 posts, 1500-2500 words each):

1. **"What Is Agentic Engineering?"**
   - Beyond prompt engineering → orchestration, complementarity, context architecture
   - Position as emerging discipline (not just skill)

2. **"The Three-Hat Framework in Practice"**
   - Battle-tested methodology with real client examples
   - Systems Architect / Product Manager / Implementation switching
   - ADHD-optimized rapid context switching as advantage

3. **"Pattern Recognition as a Superpower"**
   - How to develop this skill (69→10 tools insight, $50K stdout story)
   - What makes professionals effective with AI

4. **"The 2-Minute Rule for AI Validation"**
   - Practical metric from current client work
   - How to know if AI implementation is working

5. **"From Overwhelmed to Orchestrator"** (Personal journey)
   - Initial AI intimidation → breakthrough moments
   - Mistakes that taught everything
   - What "AI confident" actually means

### Phase 3: Framework Documentation (Ongoing)

**Deep-dives on proprietary frameworks**:
- Three-Hat Technical Leadership (enhance existing page)
- Personal OS Toolkit for AI collaboration
- 2-Minute Rule validation methodology
- Context Engineering principles (vs prompt engineering)

### Phase 4: Soft Referral Integration (Throughout)

**Contextual CTAs** after content:
- "Want personalized guidance applying these principles? → Agentic Brewery coaching"
- "See yourself in these transformations? Let's design your custom learning path"
- "These frameworks are most powerful with guided implementation"

## Integration Strategy

**daveliew.com positioning**: Free learning + thought leadership
**Agentic Brewery positioning**: Paid coaching + implementation

**Funnel**:
1. Discover via blog/portfolio (free value)
2. Engage with frameworks (demonstrate expertise)
3. See case studies (proof of results)
4. "Compare notes" CTA (soft referral)
5. Agentic Brewery coaching (conversion)

## Content vs Infrastructure Trade-offs

### Can Build Now (Content-Agnostic):
- Portfolio page activation (data exists)
- Contact/Now page enhancements
- Blog routing structure
- TOC component (Winborne-style)
- SEO metadata system

### Requires Content Decisions:
- URL structure (`/discoveries/[slug]` vs `/blog/[category]/[slug]`)
- Taxonomy (categories, tags, series)
- Content type variations (notes vs frameworks vs case studies)

## Success Metrics

**Content Engagement**:
- Blog series published (5 posts minimum)
- Portfolio case studies visible (3 activated)
- Coaching CTAs integrated (5+ strategic locations)

**Discovery**:
- "Agentic engineering" keyword ranking
- Organic traffic to blog section

**Conversion Signals**:

## Next Steps

2. **Map content series** - Which posts in what order?
3. **Build infrastructure** - Once content direction clear
4. **Write first post** - "What Is Agentic Engineering?" as foundation
