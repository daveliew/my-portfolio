**Where this appears**:
- **Post #1**: Foundational context for why agentic AI is the paradigm shift
- **Throughout series**: Woven in when relevant (not forced into every post)

**Digital agency triple meaning**:
- Human agency preserved (complementarity)
- Digital agency created (autonomous AI systems)
- Agency as business (Agentic Brewery positioning)

### 3. Fitzgerald Principle Integration

Each post embodies productive tensions, woven into narrative (not explicit sections):
- Post #1: Hype vs reality
- Post #2: Do more vs do less systematically
- Post #3: Control vs delegation
- Post #4: Breadth vs depth
- Post #5: Simplicity vs power
- Post #6: Autonomy vs coordination
- Post #7: Human UX vs agent cognition
- Post #8: Optimism vs paranoia
- Post #9: Teaching vs doing
- Post #10: Current mastery vs future learning

### 4. CTA Strategy

- **Posts #1-9**: "Learn more" soft CTAs (links to related content)
- **Post #10**: Explicit "Want personalized guidance? → Agentic Brewery coaching"

## CONTENT CONSOLIDATION STRATEGY

### Phase 1: Foundation Cleanup (Weeks 1-2)

**Merge RAG Content**:
- Delete `/app/ai-journey/techniques/rag/page.tsx`
- Expand `/app/ai-journey/techniques/agent-rag/page.tsx` with "Phase 1: RAG Fundamentals"
- Add redirect: `/ai-journey/techniques/rag` → `/ai-journey/techniques/agent-rag`
- Update `/data/ai-journey.json` references

**Merge Tool Use + MCP**:
- Delete `/app/ai-journey/techniques/tool-use/page.tsx`
- Rename MCP page to "Tool Integration: From Basics to MCP"
- Restructure `/app/ai-journey/claude/mcp/page.tsx`:
  - Phase 1: Tool Use fundamentals
  - Phase 2: When to use tools vs agents
  - Phase 3: Model Context Protocol
- Add redirect: `/ai-journey/techniques/tool-use` → `/ai-journey/claude/mcp`
