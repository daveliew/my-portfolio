## Core Philosophy

This project embodies the **Fitzgerald Principle**: "The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function."

Every aspect of the codebase demonstrates productive tensions:
- Simple surfaces with rich depth
- Technical rigor with human warmth
- AI augmentation preserving human agency

## Documentation Standards

Following the Agentic Brewery collaboration standards:
- Clear audience separation (user vs developer)
- One source of truth per topic
- Progressive disclosure (basic → advanced)
- Extensive cross-linking between related topics

## Contributing

When adding new documentation:
1. Identify the target audience (user, developer, architect)
2. Place in the appropriate subfolder
3. Update this README with the new document
4. Ensure cross-links to related documentation
