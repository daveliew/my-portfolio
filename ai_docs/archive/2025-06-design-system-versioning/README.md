# Design System Versioning (Archived)

**Archived**: December 2025
**Status**: Planning doc, versioning approach not operationally used
**Extracted To**: `ai_docs/architecture/philosophy-patterns.md`

## What Was Kept
- Philosophy consistency checks (references `npm run philosophy-check`)
- Contributing framework (4-question pattern)

## What Was Archived
- Semantic versioning concept for design system
- Version history (v0.1.0 - v1.0.0)
- Future roadmap targets (v1.1-v2.0)
- Philosophy score tracking

## Why Archived
The versioning approach was aspirational planning that never became operational. The site doesn't track design system versions. However, the philosophy validation patterns and contribution framework remain useful.
