# Notion CMS Planning (Archived)

**Archived**: December 2025
**Status**: Planned but not implemented
**Original Location**: `ai_docs/planning/`

## Contents
- `notion-cms-architecture.md` - Integration architecture for Notion as CMS
- `notion-workspace-setup.md` - Workspace structure and database schemas

## Why Archived
This was planning documentation for using Notion as a CMS for the portfolio's "learning in public" content strategy. The feature was never implemented — content is currently managed directly in the codebase via JSON data files.

## Future Use
If Notion CMS integration is revisited:
1. Review these docs for initial thinking
2. Validate against current site architecture
3. Consider if the complexity is worth it vs. current approach
