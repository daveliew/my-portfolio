## Philosophy Consistency Checks

Before major releases, run:

1. **`npm run philosophy-check`** - Automated Fitzgerald Principle scoring
2. **Review Component Patterns** - Ensure new additions follow established tensions
3. **Test User Journey** - Verify philosophy is clear throughout experience
4. **Document Changes** - Explain how changes advance or refine philosophy

## Contributing to Philosophy Evolution

When proposing design system changes, answer:

1. **Identify the Tension** - What opposing forces does this balance?
2. **Serve the Mission** - How does this advance human-AI collaboration?
3. **Show Don't Tell** - Can this demonstrate rather than just describe?
4. **Maintain Coherence** - Does this fit with existing philosophy?

> "The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function."
> — F. Scott Fitzgerald

Applied to this portfolio:
- Simple surfaces with rich depth
- Technical rigor with human warmth
- AI augmentation preserving human agency
- Proof over claims
