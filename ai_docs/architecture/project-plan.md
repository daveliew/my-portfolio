# Portfolio Website Plan (May 2025 Refresh)

## Core Narrative & Philosophy

- **Three Content Pillars:**
  1. **Personal** — Your “Why”: The meaning behind your work, your journey, and the philosophy that drives you.
  2. **Work** — Your “How”: How you deliver value, your skills, experience, and the impact you create.
  3. **AI Journey** — Your “What”: What you are learning, building, and exploring in AI and technology.

- **Guiding Principles:**
  - The site should always connect your personal meaning (“why”) to your work (“how”) and your learning journey (“what”).
  - Unique visuals and narrative remain a signature feature.
  - Modern, accessible, and mobile-friendly UI with a consistent design system.
