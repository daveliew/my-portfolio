# Documentation Migration Log

## Migration Summary (July 11, 2025)

Following the Agentic Brewery collaboration standards, all documentation files have been moved from scattered locations into the centralized `ai_docs/` folder structure.

### Files Moved

#### From Root Directory
1. `CODEBASE_ANALYSIS.md` → `ai_docs/architecture/codebase-analysis.md`
2. `DESIGN_SYSTEM_VERSION.md` → `ai_docs/architecture/design-system-version.md`
3. `README.md` → (appears to have been lost during move, needs recreation)
4. `plan.md` → `ai_docs/architecture/project-plan.md`

#### From Other Locations
5. `docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` → `ai_docs/developer_guide/design-system-guide.md`
6. `styles/design-system.md` → `ai_docs/developer_guide/design-system-reference.md`

### Files That Remain in Root (Per Standards)
- `CLAUDE.md` - Must stay in root for AI tool access
- `CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md` - Would stay in root if it existed
- `.cursorrules` - Would stay in root if it existed

### Updated References
- `CLAUDE.md` - Updated 2 references to design-system.md
- `ai_docs/developer_guide/getting-started.md` - Updated 1 reference
- `ai_docs/architecture/codebase-analysis.md` - Updated 1 reference

### Directories Cleaned Up
- `/docs/` - Removed after moving contents
- Empty directories created as part of standard structure

### Created Documentation
- `ai_docs/README.md` - Central index for all documentation
- `ai_docs/developer_guide/architecture-overview.md` - New comprehensive guide
- `ai_docs/developer_guide/getting-started.md` - New developer onboarding
- `ai_docs/developer_guide/claude-md-improvements.md` - CLAUDE.md enhancement notes
- `ai_docs/architecture/documentation-migration-log.md` - This file

## Validation Results
