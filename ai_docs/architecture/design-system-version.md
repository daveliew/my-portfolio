# Design System Version History

## Philosophy-Driven Versioning

Following semantic versioning with Fitzgerald Principle integration:

- **MAJOR**: Fundamental philosophy shifts or breaking changes to core principles
- **MINOR**: New components or patterns that embody existing philosophy
- **PATCH**: Refinements to existing patterns without changing core philosophy

## Version History

### v1.0.0 - The Fitzgerald Foundation (Current)
*Initial stable release - January 2025*

- Section structure with flow
- Navigation focus with access
- Content hierarchy showing proof

**Architecture:**
- Philosophy-first component design
- Streamlined navigation (5 focused pages)

## Version Upgrade Guidelines

### Philosophy Consistency Checks
Before any version release:

1. **Run Philosophy Validation:** `npm run philosophy-check`
2. **Review Component Patterns:** Ensure new additions follow established tensions
3. **Test User Journey:** Verify philosophy is clear throughout experience
4. **Document Changes:** Explain how changes advance or refine philosophy

### Breaking Change Considerations

**Major Version (x.0.0) Required When:**
- Core philosophy principles change
- Navigation structure fundamentally alters
- Component API breaks existing patterns
- Visual design contradicts established tensions

**Minor Version (0.x.0) Appropriate When:**
- New components follow existing philosophy
- Enhanced features maintain consistency
- Additional pages support core mission
- Improved patterns without breaking changes

**Patch Version (0.0.x) Suitable For:**
- Bug fixes maintaining philosophy
- Copy refinements
- Performance improvements
- Accessibility enhancements

## Philosophy Evolution Tracking

Track how well we embody the Fitzgerald Principle over time:

| Version | Philosophy Score | Key Philosophy Improvements |
|---------|------------------|----------------------------|
| v1.0.0  | 7%              | Baseline measurement       |
| v1.1.0  | Target: 20%     | Component philosophy enhancement |
| v1.2.0  | Target: 35%     | Interactive philosophy demonstrations |
| v2.0.0  | Target: 50%+    | AI-assisted philosophy integration |

The goal isn't 100% - that would be dogmatic. We want strong philosophical coherence while maintaining flexibility for evolution.

## Contributing to Philosophy Evolution

When proposing design system changes:

1. **Identify the Tension:** What opposing forces does this balance?
2. **Serve the Mission:** How does this advance human-AI collaboration?
3. **Show Don't Tell:** Can this demonstrate rather than just describe?
4. **Maintain Coherence:** Does this fit with existing philosophy?

Remember: "The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function." - F. Scott Fitzgerald
