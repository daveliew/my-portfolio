# Balanced Site Strategy - Dave Liew Portfolio

## Core Identity
**"Dave Liew - I build tools that solve real problems"**

A pattern-recognizing tool builder who spots inefficiencies and creates solutions. 10+ years of experience across Meta, Unity Technologies, Michelin-starred restaurant, and education startups.

## The Balance We're Striking

### What We're Keeping (High Value)
1. **3-Hat Framework** - A unique, practical methodology
   - Systems Architect: See the full picture
   - Product Manager: Define what matters
   - Implementation: Build it myself

2. **Professional Background** - Credibility and range
   - Meta: Products reaching millions
   - Unity: Scaled systems
   - 4 ventures co-founded (1 exit)
   - Still coding daily

3. **Live Proof** - Active projects demonstrating the approach
   - Currently on 3 client projects
   - Real metrics (protected by NDA)
   - Patterns can be shared

### What We're Removing (Overpromises)
- No workshop commitments (yet)
- No content schedule
- No community management promises
- No "coming soon" features

### What We're Adjusting (Framing)
- From: "I'll teach you everything"
- To: "This is how I work - let's talk if you need help"

## Content Guidelines

### Tone
- Direct and practical
- No fluff or buzzwords
- "I build" not "I pioneer"
- Show, don't tell

### Privacy Balance
- Protect client details
- Share patterns and principles
- Use categories, not names
- Focus on outcomes

### Growth Strategy
- Start minimal
- Add case studies when cleared
- Build pattern library slowly
- No pressure or deadlines

## Future Considerations

When time permits:
1. **Pattern Library** - Document one pattern when discovered
2. **Case Studies** - Add when clients approve
3. **Tool Showcases** - Public versions of private tools
4. **Workshops** - Only when genuinely ready

## Success Metrics
- Clear communication (5-second test)
- Professional credibility established
- No false promises
- Easy to maintain
- Room for organic growth

## Implementation Notes
- Keep current design system
- Maintain philosophy page separately
- Focus on clarity over cleverness
- Test on mobile first
