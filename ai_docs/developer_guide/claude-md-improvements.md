## Key Improvements for Future Claude Instances

1. **Immediate Context**: Philosophy-driven architecture is clear from the start
2. **Validation First**: Pre-deployment checks are prominently featured
3. **Common Pitfalls**: ESLint quote escaping is explicitly called out
4. **Quick Commands**: Efficient validation commands for development
5. **Documentation Path**: Clear pointer to detailed guides in `/ai_docs/`

## Documentation Created

Following your ai_docs standards:
- `/ai_docs/developer_guide/architecture-overview.md` - Comprehensive architecture guide
- `/ai_docs/developer_guide/getting-started.md` - Developer onboarding guide
- `/ai_docs/developer_guide/claude-md-improvements.md` - This summary

## Philosophy Score Note

The automated philosophy validation currently scores 7%, which is intentionally low to leave room for growth while maintaining the core principle of productive tensions.
