# Dave Liew - Agentic AI Architect (Full Documentation)

> Building AI colleagues, not AI tools. Exploring human-AI collaboration through the Fitzgerald Principle.

## About David Liew

David Liew is an AI engineer and builder based in Singapore, pioneering practical frameworks for human-AI collaboration. Background includes Meta (Technical Solutions Consultant) and Google (Advertising Solutions Architect). His work focuses on Context Engineering—architecting what AI knows before it reasons—rather than prompt tricks.

Core belief: "Time compounds faster than money." AI should amplify human capabilities, not replace human agency.

## Key Frameworks

### Fitzgerald Principle
Named after F. Scott Fitzgerald's observation about first-rate intelligence: holding two opposed ideas simultaneously while retaining the ability to function. Applied to AI work:
- Simple surfaces with rich depth
- Technical rigor with human warmth
- AI augmentation preserving human agency
- Automated systems with manual overrides

### Context Engineering
The discipline of architecting informational environments where understanding emerges. Goes beyond prompt engineering to include:
- CLAUDE.md files (persistent AI memory)
- MCP tools (extended capabilities)
- Conversation design (shaping understanding)
- Knowledge architecture (what AI knows before reasoning)

### Three-Hat Framework
Rapid context switching methodology validated on 3 client projects:
1. **Systems Architect**: High-level design, dependencies, trade-offs
2. **Product Manager**: User needs, feature prioritization, business value
3. **Implementation**: Technical execution, code quality, testing

### Complementarity Principle
AI amplifies human capabilities (moral agency, creativity, embodied wisdom). Not replacement narrative, but augmentation. AI handles what scales, humans handle what matters.
