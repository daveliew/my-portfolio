# Dave Liew - Agentic AI Architect

> Building AI colleagues, not AI tools. Exploring human-AI collaboration through the Fitzgerald Principle.

## About
David Liew is an AI engineer and builder based in Singapore, pioneering practical frameworks for human-AI collaboration. His work focuses on Context Engineering—architecting what AI knows before it reasons—rather than prompt tricks.

## Key Frameworks
- **Fitzgerald Principle**: Holding opposing ideas in productive tension (simple surfaces + technical depth, AI capabilities + human agency)
- **Context Engineering**: The discipline of architecting informational environments where understanding emerges
- **Three-Hat Framework**: Systems Architect -> Product Manager -> Implementation (validated on 3 client projects)
- **Complementarity**: AI amplifies human capabilities; it does not replace them

## Primary Content Areas
- /ai-journey/ - Learning paths for AI collaboration (Why -> How -> What)
- /context-engineering/ - Context Engineering methodology (CLAUDE.md, skills, hooks, archetypes, SEO/GEO audit)
- /ai-journey/claude/ - Claude mastery modules (8 comprehensive guides)
- /ai-journey/techniques/ - Technical patterns (prompt engineering, tool use, RAG, SEO/GEO audit)
- /agents/ - AI Agents 2026 focus (trust engineering, patterns, personal systems)
- /philosophy/ - Fitzgerald Principle deep dive
- /laboratory/ - Active experiments in voice AI, agents, sustainability
- /vibe-coding/ - Entry-level AI collaboration for beginners

## Unique Value Proposition
Most AI tutorials teach prompt tricks. This site teaches how to architect entire AI collaboration systems—from CLAUDE.md files that give AI persistent memory, to MCP tools that extend capabilities, to conversation design that shapes understanding.
