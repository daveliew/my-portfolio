# David Liew - Agentic Engineer

> Most people use AI to do more. I use it to do less—systematically.

Building human-AI collaboration systems through Context Engineering and the Three-Hat Framework

**Validated across 8+ projects including enterprise platforms, therapy practice automation, and e-commerce systems**

---

## 🎯 Core Frameworks

### Context Engineering
Not prompt engineering—architecting informational environments where understanding emerges

Shifting focus from 'what to say to AI' to 'what context enables effective reasoning'

### Three-Hat Framework
**Systems Architect:** High-level design preventing complexity explosion (3→12 agents without chaos)
**Product Manager:** Data-driven prioritization (30min→2min user journey optimization)
**Implementation:** Quality gates and monitoring for production systems

*Validated across enterprise, SME, and startup contexts*
