# Portfolio Website Plan

## Long-Term Vision (Stable)

- **Philosophy & Core Narrative:**
  - The Virtuous Cycle / Life System is the foundation of the site and your work. This philosophy, leverage systems, and core narrative are stable and rarely change.
  - The site should always clearly connect your "why" (philosophy) to your "what" (projects, learning, and impact).

- **Core Structure:**
  - Home
  - Now & Life System (philosophy + current focus)
  - Skills & Experience
  - AI Journey (with Roadmap, Skills Matrix, Case Studies)
  - Sustainability
  - Business
  - Tech Ed
  - Contact

- **Tech Stack:**
  - Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, TypeScript
  - Modern, accessible, and mobile-friendly UI
  - Consistent design system and navigation

- **Content Principles:**
  - Unique visuals and narrative are a signature feature
  - All major sections are accessible from the navbar
  - The site is a living record, but the core philosophy and structure are stable
